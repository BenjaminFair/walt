### TeensyUSB code ###

Refer to [Teensyduino instructions](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensyduino.html)
to set up the development environment.

When compiling using Arduino IDE, remember to set the mode to "Serial + MIDI".

Note: as of this writing the "Serial + MIDI" mode is only available in the beta version of Teensyduiono.
This mode was added in [this commit](https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/cores/commit/a480cd28da49406c297d241a3cbb535e83bec7eb)

Also check out [this template](https://github.com/apmorton/teensy-template)
for using make and a text editor of your choice for comiling TeensyUSB code.
